  now that we have the disclaimers out of the way, this a simple bruteforcer to 
run on a computer (windows) that types all of the "passwords" in the file "list.txt"

use: 
    -add your list.txt file with all of your passwords to the folder
    -make sure to set your cursor to type on whatver you want to bruteforce
    -press f1 and watch as the passwords get entered
